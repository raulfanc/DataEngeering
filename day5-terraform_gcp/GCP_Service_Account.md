When you interact with Google Cloud services programmatically, you need to authenticate your requests using a service account. A service account is a special type of Google account that represents your application rather than an individual user. This account is used to authenticate and authorize access to Google Cloud APIs and resources.

The service account JSON key file is a file containing the necessary credentials for your application to authenticate itself. The environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is used to point to this JSON key file, so that Google Cloud SDK and client libraries know where to find the credentials.

1.  First, you need to obtain a JSON key file for your service account:

    -   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    -   Click the project drop-down and select or create the project for which you want to add an API key.
    -   Go to the [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page.
    -   Click "Create credentials" and then "Service account key".
    -   Choose "JSON" as the key type, and click "Create". The JSON key file will be downloaded to your computer.
2.  Set the environment variable to point to your downloaded JSON key file:

    Replace `<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json` with the actual path to the downloaded JSON key file and run the command in your terminal:
    
    arduinoCopy code
    
    `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json"`
    
    You can run this command from any directory. The environment variable will be set for the current terminal session.

3.  Refresh the token/session and verify the authentication:
    
    Run the following command to refresh the access token and ensure that the authentication is set up correctly:
    
    arduinoCopy code
    
    `gcloud auth application-default login`
    
    This command will open your browser and prompt you to log in with your Google account. After logging in, you should see a message indicating that you have successfully authenticated.


Remember that setting the environment variable using the `export` command is temporary and will only persist for the current terminal session. If you want to set the environment variable permanently, you can add the `export` command to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`).
